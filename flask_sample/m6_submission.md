<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Did you have any issues during setup and if so how did you resolve them, otherwise what did you learn?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Issues during setup:<div><ol><li>pytest hasn&#39;t been installed globally so I followed the video on<br>the recordings section to fix it.</li><li>Learnt how to use the pip freeze command.<br>This was helpful while resolving the above issue.</li><li>After the app has been deployed,<br>I got to know that the app has crashed and it didn&#39;t work<br>when opened the app through heroku dashboard. This was because the main.py was<br>misplaced and had to place it under the correct directory. The logs in<br>heroku dashboard indicated a ModulenotfoundError, stating that main has not been found. All<br>this time, my main.py file was inside the venv folder.Why did it not<br>find the main file venv folder? because I added the venv folder to<br>.gitignore file. TLDR; fixed the path of main.py and the issue was resolved.&nbsp;</li></ol></div><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What can you tell me about docker? Describe the various steps needed to get an app ran inside a docker container in your own words</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Docker is a platform to develop and build applications using something called docker<br>containers. A docker container contains everything like libraries, dependencies packages needed to run<br>an application. To get an app running inside a docker container we first<br>need to write a script of an application and then use the docker<br>commands from our terminal. We can use the command to generate number of<br>instances of our app and get the results in seconds. While using the<br>commands we also mention the route(the port that the app should to listen<br>to) and build our docker container image.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> What is Heroku? Why do you feel it was chosen for this class?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Heroku is a platform to host web apps, through dynos. Dynos are virtual<br>computers that run on the cloud. Since we work on web apps for<br>this class, we use Heroku to help host our web apps on the<br>internet. Further reading helped me understand that heroku dosn&#39;t actually host our web<br>apps but AWS does. Heroku deploys all our web apps to AWS which<br>provide the infrastructure needed for or apps to run. Heroku is just a<br>platform to host our web apps on AWS. Thus the name (PaaS, platform<br>as a service)<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> What is flask? List a few things you learned about it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Flask is a framework to build our web applications. It doesn&#39;t require installing<br>separate libraries and dependencies, it comes with its own packages to do so<br>when we install flask. We write our web apps just like we write<br>any other python script. We use several useful decorators to indicate where the<br>app should be routed to and which port it should listen to. We<br>write the functionality of our websites within this script. We can also incorporate<br>HTML into these scripts and design the structure of our website.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> What is the difference between a Dockerfile and a Github Action .yml file?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <ul><li>A dockerfile is a text file that contains commands that can be run<br>automatically to create a docker image. The commands include what requirements are needed<br>for the app to run, which port it should be listening to and<br>also how many instances of our applications that have to be run. In<br>this HW, we build our app on a built-in image called python:3.10-slim image.<br>This dockerfile will automatically install all our requirements and assemble the image.</li><li>A Github<br>Action .yml file is used to alter the behavior of github commands. <i><b>From<br>what I understand :&nbsp;</b></i><br>1.&nbsp; When we use github comands like commit and push<br>we generally update the files on the github to match our files on<br>local machine. When we use git push we see the changes in our<br>files on github that were on our local machine.&nbsp;<br>2. When we add a<br>.yml file and then use git push, we can directly use the push<br>command to do something more. like not only updating our current files but<br>also deploy them to a target branch. How do we do that? we<br>add the the functionality of this command to our yml file. We write<br>the functionality of what a github command must do when use it.&nbsp;<br>3. In<br>the yml files that were provided in class, we changed the behavior of<br>the push command to do a particular job, i.e., to identify what working<br>directory must be used, check our heroku credentials, api key, to which app<br>it must be deployed to and also which database it must use. We<br>use github secrets to create a key-value pairs and incorporate them in the<br>yml file.&nbsp;</li><li>Basically the dockerfile is used in this HW is to run the<br>commands automatically and the GIthub Action .yml files are used to alter the<br>behavior of the git push command.</li></ul><br></td></tr>
